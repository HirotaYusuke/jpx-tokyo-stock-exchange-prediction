Perform EDA on the dataset to extract valuable insight about the process generating the time series. **(Covered in this notebook)**\n","2. Model the dataset based on exploratory analysis (univariable model without exogenous variables).\n","3. Use an automated approach (AutoML) to improve the performance.\n","4.

In the second row, we have only removed the wandering behavior by taking a first difference.

The ACF (preaking at seasonal period of 12 and its multiples) and PACF (peaking at fundamental frequency of 0.0833 and its multiples) still show the seasonal behavior.\n","2. In the third row, we have taken first difference followed by a seasonal difference of 12. Now, we can see that the peaking at seasonal multiples is gone from both ACF and Periodogram. There is still a little bit of autoregresssive properties that we have not taken care of but by looking at the PACF, maybe p=1 seems like a reasonable value to use (most lags after that are insignificant).\n","\n","**Conclusion**\n","* If you were modeling this with ARIMA, the model to try would be **ARIMA(1,1,0)x(0,1,0,12)**.\n","* Other models could use this information appropriately.
